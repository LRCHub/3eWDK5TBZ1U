Curiousity
I am longing to be free
From longing
Haunted by questions
I'm afraid to fake
Hesitation
Afraid to be a disgrace

I'm sorry to disappoint you
Do you still love me?
And now I'm still your baby
Don't disown me
A women is supposed to love a man
And I've tried the best I can
But this is not who I am

Born to failure
Fightin' for forgiveness
I surrender
In a war that's pointless
Gaining dignity
Losing lies from my past
Who's society
To label me on outcast

I'm sorry to disappoint you
Do you still love me?
And now I'm still your baby
Don't disown me
A women is supposed to love a man
And I've tried the best I can
But this is not who I am

I'm free
I no longer gonna hide
I'm free
It's not my fault
This is just who I am
Born to failure - I'm free
We can't hide who we are
Gaining dignity
To label me on outcast

Curiousity
I am longing to be free
From longing

I'm sorry to disappoint you
Do you still love me?
And now I'm still your baby
Don't disown me
A women is supposed to love a man
And I've tried the best I can
But this is not who I am...
