...Oh you think you're gonna do something different than what
I'm doing right now.
...just having a nice pleasant conversation with your friends.
...whatever you do this is a wonderful phrase by Gandhi.

...God!
I am who I am, and what I am, and I will be what I will be. Ok?
Present tense: I am who I am. Not was to be, but I am.
Can you imagine that? I am who I am.
I am who I am.
I will be who I am and what I am.
I will be who I am and what I am.
In other words, I'm going to do it. I am who I am.
I am what I am.
I will be who I am. What I am I will be.
Not going to be. Not was.
I am who I am! I am what I am! And I will be what I will be!
You are who you are and who you are. Who you are!
Who does he think he is?
