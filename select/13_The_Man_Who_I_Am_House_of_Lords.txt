The sun just touched the morning
And from dreams I awake
Drifting in a haze I see
The light on your face
The sun is rising, rising still
With no hue of the afternoon
The wind whispers on my face
You're the only one

Do you know who I am
Ask yourself
And tell me what you know about me
Don't be afraid to look at me and see
The man who I am

Underneath the silent sky I wait
In this fortress from the sun
My fate follows close to me
It wants for me to know
The spirit flowing in my mind
Is alive with your glow
The quiet sounds of loneliness
Without you, I'd be lost

Do you know who I am
Ask yourself
And then tell me, tell me who I am

Do you know what I'm feeling
Tell me, do you know who I am
I'm the man in love with you
Is that good enough
'Cause I believe in you and me
'Cause that is the man who I am
And I cannot hide
And I'm not afraid to show it

Do you know who I am
Ask yourself
And tell me what you know about me now
Don't be afraid to look at me and see
Finding out the truth, this is my release
To scream out to the world
How much I want you to know
The man who I am

Tell me, do you know
The man who I am
Tell me, do you know
The man who I am
Tell me, do you know
The man who I am
